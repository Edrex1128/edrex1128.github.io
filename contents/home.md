#### About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science Engineering at Southeast University, supervised by Professor [Guilin Qi](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/gqi/main.htm). My research interests include <strong>LLMs/MLLMs reasoning optimization</strong>, <strong>generative AI</strong>, <strong>LLMs scaling</strong>.

Currently, I am working on refining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs/MLLMs, especially in reducing the verbose outputs and striking a balance between exploration and exploitation of the reasoning trajectories. In the future, I plan to extend the same paradigm to the multimodal domain. A primary objective is to facilitate a dynamic, self-adaptive switch between System 1 (intuitive) and System 2 (deliberative) reasoning in MLLMs to enhance their computational efficiency and performance.
